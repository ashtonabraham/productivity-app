# Daily Focus

A minimal productivity app: pick 3 tasks, focus with a timer, wrap up your day, build a streak.

- **Today**: Choose up to 3 tasks from your Tasklog, mark them done, run a flexible focus timer (15 / 25 / 45 min + 5 min break), then **Wrap up day** to lock the day and count your streak.
- **Tasklog**: Create, edit, delete tasks and promote them to Today.
- Data is stored in `localStorage` (single-user, local only).

## Run
